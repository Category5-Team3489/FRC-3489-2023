Priority:

Perhaps:

Eventually:
Limelight autoplacement controls led strips to indicate things
Set drive motors to coast mode for offset config
Confetti led pattern when robot is in endgame and balanced
Pure pursuit
Sequence to pickup a tipped over cone with wrist, gripper and arm
Tell robot how far cone has slipped down somehow
Just point wheels towards point with odometry and drive
    P control when within threshold distance
    Use SlewRateLimiter to limit accel
Can cubes be launched?
    Create map for motor speed and distance
    Drag and robot current robot velocity
    Use campose from limelight
    Kinematic equations
Prevent arm from lowering on placement area
Limit translation speed when arm is up
Limit rotation speed when arm is up
Slow down cardinal direction turning and heading keeping when arm is up
    Use arm distance from center of robot to make proportional?
Quick press of rotation trigger all the way down does an incremental rotation
Offset arm constant force spring with model
