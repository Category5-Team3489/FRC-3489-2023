Pit Testing:
	Make sure code changes don't crash anything
	SET FORCE HOME BUTTON BINDING
	Just try driving
		Make sure steering offsets are good
	Test arm at preset heights
	Intake speed presets, low outtake too fast //////////////
	Intake stops and recognizes game pieces correctly with color sensor
    Do we need a higher anti eat timeout? ////////////
	Spin robot on the cart to test NavX2
		See how heading angle changes with clockwise rotation and record
	Does navx zeroing behave correctly?
    Test Campose, how does it behave?
	Does pose estimator initialize correctly when april tag is visible
		Does navx get setup correctly?
	Test pose estimator with navx reset

Practice Field Testing:
    Human player station arm angle constants good?
	Tune autoplacement at all scoring positions
    Test arm heights
    Test placement speeeds, cube
    Does limelight campose set up navx correctly?
	Auto:
		Place, Taxi
		Place, Balance

Field Testing:
	Is Low Outake speed good for repositioning a piece
	

Tune limelight, do you want 6hz again, or faster better?

hybrid nodes with april tags
cubes with april tags
change limelight stream settings for good bandwidth
low arm position outake speed is too high piece gets launched when repositioning
Max angular velocity degrees per second for heading keeping for automation
DriveCommandBase
	Set isautomating false on command cancel/interrupt or complete of whole sequence
Auto leveling for charging station

Cone flipping toggle button, use last one of 6 on manipulator stick
Lift slightly above tipped cone, press again bring down onto ground, lifting cone up?
