///////////////////////////////////////

Try without changing anything
Set up steering encoder offsets



See how much robot rotates when trying to drive straight in each direction
Decide on drive motor speed remapping
Look at pose estimator, how does x, y and rotation change with inputs
Test intake and out taking cone and cube
Test arm heights
Test heading keeping, not dpad
test heading set on dpad
start auto and limelight




///////////////////////////////////////////

Driver camera works on shuffleboard?
Test arm floor pickup button
Test color sensor reinit logic by unplugging and replugging
Test drive speed limiting

See if carrying position / low arm angle is good
Tune mid cone placement logic
Test heading keeping code
Anti cube eating code
Decide if reintaking cone is needed
center of rotation stuff, be sure to change to from 1..max, not 0..max for scaling
