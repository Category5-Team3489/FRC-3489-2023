Priority:
Super slow accel button

Perhaps:
Use states for arm and wrist
Slow this everywhere motor.setPeriodicFramePeriod(PeriodicFrame.kStatus0, 20); // TODO Should this be done in other places or with other frames?
History of arm commands with Stack, have max size
Some shuffleboard abstraction for suppliers that will register them somewhere
    Semi random updates, so everything doesn't update at once
    Provide update rate in hz
Only allow arm to home once unless force homed?
    Only home on not homed and limit switch rising edge

Eventually:
Limelight autoplacement controls led strips to indicate things
Pickup position button toggles gripper position?
Set drive motors to coast mode for offset config
Pass odometry object into drive commands?
Log high arm currents and low velocities?
Confetti led pattern when robot is in endgame and balanced
Pure pursuit
Sequence to pickup a tipped over cone with wrist, gripper and arm
Tell robot how far cone has slipped down somehow
Just point wheels towards point with odometry and drive
    P control when within threshold distance
    Use SlewRateLimiter to limit accel
Can cubes be launched?
    Create map for motor speed and distance
    Drag and robot current robot velocity
    Use campose from limelight
    Kinematic equations
Prevent arm from lowering on placement area
Limit translation speed when arm is up
Limit rotation speed when arm is up
Slow down cardinal direction turning and heading keeping when arm is up
    Use arm distance from center of robot to make proportional?
Is rotation of robot finicky?
Quick press of rotation trigger all the way down does an incremental rotation
Offset arm constant force spring with model


Idea Archive:
Lower arm height slightly at human player station
No arm correction, just move wrist instead
Move to carry position after picking a game piece up automatically // ISSUE WITH THIS IF AT HUMAN PLAYER STATION OR NOT FLOOR PICKUP POS
Manipulator POV for wrist control, bump up and down to go between two positions?
